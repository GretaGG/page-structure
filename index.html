    <h1> How to use HTML effectivly</h1>
    <h2>March 22<sup>nd</sup> 2023</h2>
    <p>This is an introduction on how to make HTML Web pages and some of the terms you may come across when making HTML pages.</p>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structural Markup:</strong> The elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.</li>
        <li><strong>Semantic Markup:</strong> Tells you where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quote and who said it, the meaning of acrynyms and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is how to make a word appear <b>BOLD</b>.</p>
    <p>This is how to <i>Italicize</i>a word.</p>
    <p>Adding a line break will become necessary when your paragraphs are longer than 45-75 characters. <br> 
        One reason we use that rule is we have found its tiresome for the eyes to read as the lines become <br>
        longer and more unnatrual.</p>

    <h2>Responsive Web Design.</h2>
    <p>Here are some of my favorite websites to study when I think of user experience and responsive design.</p>

            <li><a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/brilliant-script-screenplay-format/" alt="studio binder">Studio Binder</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.tofugu.com/" alt="Tofugu">Tofugu</a></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>Now I will link an image to show you. This is a photo from one of my favorite films. Howl's Moving Castle. I hope to be able to paint this beautifully one day.</p>
